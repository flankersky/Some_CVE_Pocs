This is a critical bug(CVSS Score 9.8) I found in Qualcomm's WLAN HOST driver

# Steps to reproduce:
1 Enable the KASAN, re-compile the kernel.
2 Install scapy, airmon-ng; and you need a wifi adapter in monitor mode.(I use TL-WN722N)
3 run the poc.sh
4 Open your phone's WiFi setting to check the availabe WiFi list, if you can see a 'aaaaaaaaa0aaaaaaaaa0aaaaaaaaa0',it means the beacon send sucessfully.
Meanwhile, you can see a KASAN report in your dmesg output.
