This is a critical bug(CVSS Score 9.8) I found in Qualcomm's WLAN HOST driver

## Steps to reproduce:
- Enable the KASAN, re-compile the kernel.   
- Install scapy, airmon-ng; and you need a wifi adapter in monitor mode.(I use TL-WN722N)  
- run the poc.sh  
- Open your phone's WiFi setting to check the availabe WiFi list, if you can see a 'aaaaaaaaa0aaaaaaaaa0aaaaaaaaa0',it means the beacon send sucessfully. Meanwhile, you can see a KASAN report in your dmesg output.
